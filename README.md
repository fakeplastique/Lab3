The structure consists of no more than 64 consecutive blocks of the same size, each of which is an array. The structure remembers the chronology of adding elements. At the beginning there is exactly one block. If you need to increase the amount of memory, an additional block is added first, and if this reserve is used up, 5% of the oldest elements are deleted.
There is no automatic shrinkage of the memory space.
